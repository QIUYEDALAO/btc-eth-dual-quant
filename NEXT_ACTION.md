# Next Action

Implement the approved Freqtrade-first hardening sequence:

1. Architecture governance and historical evidence notices: completed in PR #8.
2. Correct M0 funding-interval and ZIP/REST audit semantics: code hardening merged in PR #9; real audit evidence remains blocked and must not be treated as pass.
3. Pin and validate Freqtrade as the primary research framework: completed in PR #10.
4. Revalidate M1B with strict 1-hour event-time semantics: implemented on `codex/m1b-event-time-revalidation`; result remains `failed_validation`.

Immediate action: review the strict M1B event-time report and CI evidence. The corrected run has 13 complete cycles and 2 incomplete end positions, so M1B remains `failed_validation`. M0 remains `audit_revalidation_required`, and neither report may approve M2.

Rules:

- No strategy is eligible for M2.
- M0 remains accepted infrastructure but is audit_revalidation_required until step 2 passes.
- Historical M1A/M1B numerical claims marked superseded or invalidated must not support approval.
- Do not enter M2.
- Do not run live trading.
- Do not run paper trading with real API.
- Do not request, read, or use API keys.
- Do not implement execution/live.
- Do not place or cancel orders.
