# Next Action

Under the Freqtrade-first architecture, T2 passed and merged in PR #23. T3
unified metrics is now the only newly authorized implementation and must start
on a new branch. This closeout does not start T3.

T2 evidence now records:

1. Complete BTC/ETH golden 1m from `2023-10-01` through `2026-06-30`.
2. Deterministic 5m/15m derivatives with zero incomplete research buckets.
3. Zero numeric differences against 66 official monthly 15m archives.
4. Traceable pre-start quarantine kept outside formal research data.
5. Freqtrade 2026.6 pinned-container readability for all six jsongz caches.

After T0, execute `T1 -> T2 -> T3 -> T4` before M1D feasibility. T3 must build
the unified daily-MTM/PSR/DSR metrics and reproduce the expert M1C regression. T5 must
pass before T6 fixed design, and T6 must pass before any Freqtrade strategy code.

Locked conditions: discrete completed-15m events, authoritative 1m detail, 5m
sensitivity, `max_open_trades=1`, no fixed holding duration, no daily trade
quota, daily-MTM MaxDD <=15%, OOS Sharpe >=1.0, and PSR >=0.95.

M1C remains `failed_validation` after expert correction. Its OOS daily-MTM
Sharpe is 0.7882/0.7528 and MaxDD is 23.47%/24.47%; do not tune or rescue it.

M0 source differences must be quarantined and sensitivity-tested. Never select
the more profitable official data version.

Rules:

- No strategy is eligible for M2.
- M0 remains accepted infrastructure but is audit_revalidation_required until step 2 passes.
- Historical M1A/M1B numerical claims marked superseded or invalidated must not support approval.
- The strict M1B event-time report is the current numerical evidence and remains failed_validation.
- Do not enter M2.
- Do not run live trading.
- Do not run paper trading with real API.
- Do not request, read, or use API keys.
- Do not implement execution/live.
- Do not place or cancel orders.
- Follow `PROJECT_EXECUTION_CHECKLIST.md` in dependency order.
