# Next Action

## Immediate Task

The fixed `2020-01` through `2026-06` V4 public requalification has completed
with a deterministic machine `pass` and is pending PR review and merge.

The only immediate task is to validate and merge that evidence. After merge,
create a separate governance closeout. Do not run U-03F from this branch.

- Source freeze: `c86310f8a734da214e4119268af874db6398d1b2552426c22431f97d1cffec6c`.
- Cold/warm/worker artifact set: `4cfca060b423f4071c831c9ce52556a3a66837fb7326f689245253e13165fde6`.
- Run manifest: `f55f2829be39445a8489a0863ee5e013c481351d64797251bd79bc199376b127`.
- Result: 78 months and 1,170 membership rows; all blocking counters are zero.

## Current Decision

U-03D passed and merged in PR #70 at `5ab69e2`. U-03E then rebuilt the V2
public evidence twice with different concurrency and identical outputs:

- Artifact-set hash: `b7c89f2465f570db0687ed20f81a84d570e8746eb0be95c2767429733c0bdfb7`.
- Deterministic mismatches: 0.
- Historical symbols / months / membership rows: 676 / 78 / 1,170.
- Gap records / unresolved gaps: 227 / 0.
- Excluded-category members / synthetic fills / replacements: 0 / 0 / 0.
- Processing blockers: 3.

The adjudicated blockers are official-source evidence, not ingestion failures:

- BTTUSDT 2019-01 monthly ZIP contains one negative `base_volume`; the official
  daily ZIP and both public REST hosts agree on the positive row.
- BTTUSDT 2019-02 monthly ZIP contains four negative `base_volume` rows; the
  official daily ZIPs and both public REST hosts agree on positive rows.
- AXSUSDT 2026-02 monthly and daily ZIPs both contain two byte-identical
  2026-02-10 rows; both public REST hosts return one matching row.

The relevant files passed official checksum verification. The V2 result is
therefore `blocked`, as required by ADR-0012. V1 remains superseded historical
evidence; it cannot override the machine result.

The historical V1/V2 comparison covers all 78 months: 6 months changed, with 7
additions, 7 removals and 33 rank changes. This comparison is diagnostic only
and was not an input to V2 qualification.

M1H-03 is complete. Public funding-data qualification passed, then the one
frozen sealed-IS paper observation failed feasibility without changing the
protocol or opening OOS.

- Independent market episodes: 131.
- Projected full / sealed-OOS episodes: 187 / 56.
- Combined median 24h close displacement: 0.0714% versus 1.80% required.
- BTCUSDT / ETHUSDT median 24h close displacement: 0.0731% / 0.0132%.
- Maximum single-year episode share: 48.09% versus 45% allowed.
- Median 24h MFE: 2.3108%, disclosed as path evidence only and not a Gate override.

M1H is `failed_feasibility`; PR #65 merged the truthful stop record at
`57c2b1c`. M1H fixed rules, strategy implementation, backtesting and OOS
opening are blocked. M1E, M1G and M1H have exhausted the frozen ADR-0010
BTC/ETH two-asset candidate queue.

## Allowed Next Work

1. Run the committed V4 requalification checker and full validation.
2. Review and merge the V4 requalification PR only if all GitHub checks pass.
3. From merged main, create the separate V4 governance closeout.
4. Preserve all V3 evidence and keep U-03F, U-04, strategy work and M2 blocked until closeout.

U-03E is closed as a truthful blocked milestone, not an active implementation
task. U-03F may run only after a future U-03E pass under valid source evidence.
Cross-sectional hypothesis design
requires U-03F pass plus a separate task; it is not an allowed workaround for
the current blocker.

## Prohibited

- Freqtrade-first remains the architecture for any future single-leg research.
- No strategy is eligible for M2.
- Do not enter M2.
- Do not change the M1H percentile, 365-day window, horizons, interval policy, clustering or Gates.
- Do not add a fourth BTC/ETH indicator candidate or reuse this sealed IS outcome for parameter selection.
- Do not rescue M1B, M1G or M1H through a broader symbol list.
- Do not write M1H fixed rules, strategy code, Freqtrade implementation or a backtest.
- Do not open OOS or increment the DSR opened-trial count.
- Do not access API keys, private data, private smoke, dry-run/live, orders, cancellation, matching, wallets, trading permissions or `execution/live`.
- Do not commit raw, DuckDB, Freqtrade runtime data, logs, SQLite, `.env` or private payloads.
- M2 remains blocked and no strategy is approved for trading.
